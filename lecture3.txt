lapply: loop over a list and evaluate a function on each element of the list
sapply: same as lapply but try to simplity the result
apply: apply a function over the margins of an array
tapply: apply a function over subsets of a vector (table apply)
mapply: multivariate version of lapply

An auxiliary function: split is also useful, particularly in conjunction with lapply//sapply

lapply( x, FUN, ...)

is.vector
is.null
is.integer
...

x is a list,
FUN is a function,
... is ... parameters
